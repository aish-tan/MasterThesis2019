\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. Images:\
\
Drop image files or folders containing image files in the main screen. All the files will appear, even the non-image ones. Select \'91Custom\'92 under the 
\f1\b Filter Images? 
\f0\b0 .\
\
Select \'91All\'92 in the 
\f1\b Match _ of the following rules
\f0\b0 .\
\
Since the image files consists of thumbnail images as well, they need to be filtered out. Luckily, these files have \'91thumb\'92 or \'91thumbnail\'92 present in their names, and thereby can be easily identified. Select these options in the 
\f1\b Select the rule criteria
\f0\b0  option:  \'91Files\'92 \'91Does not\'92 \'91Contain\'92 \'91thumb\'92. \
\
System files which are accidentally present can be filtered out in the same way. \
\
Click 
\f1\b Apply filters to the file list
\f0\b0  to view which image files will be processed.\
\
A file name appears like this: \
U2OS-20X-BpAHDDB-100uM50uM25uM12uM-LIVE_C03_s3_w24995BD36-A511-48A3-AFE3-D6FED32C7383\
\
2. Metadata:\
\
While this is an optional module, it can be very handy to automate the pipeline workflow in Cell Profiler and later during the analysis in Python/R, since it generates metadata, I.e., data about data, from different sources. \
In our research group, we practice the convention of having informative filenames of the image files as output from ImageXpress microscope. These file names usually consist of the cell line used in the experiment, the magnification at which microscope is set, the treatments and the treatment\'92s various concentrations used in treating the cells and more description if seems necessary. The microscope\'92s software is by default programmed to add well and site imaged to every filename. Hence, image\'92s name is information-rich, and this module help extract this information.\
\

\
3. NamesAndTypes\
\
The CellProfiler description for this module reads \'93The NamesAndTypes module allows you to assign a meaningful name to each image by which other modules will refer to it.\'94 \
\
With NamesAndTypes module, meaningful names can be assigned to each image by which other modules will refer to it. With the help of this module, different images revealing different data from the same well and site in the experiments which have multiplexed dyes, like Cell Painting experiments, can be grouped together as the same \'91image set\'92 . In simple words, it is like putting together different layers revealing different levels of information about the same object, to generate a single rich profile about that object. \
